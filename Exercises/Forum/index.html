                    Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.</p>

                <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. 
                    It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. 
                    Individual commitment to a group effort—that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation work.</p>
